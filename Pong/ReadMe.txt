pression right arrow 5 times crashed my aplication:
i can now press the arrow as much as i please.

character names diddnt have a \0 at the end of the string causing it to display random junk after the name the names now only show the correct letters.

every time you would read a new record (press right or left arrow) the application would claim more memory i fixed this be clearing the old record before reading the new one.
